Stable Diffusion Textual Inversion Concepts Library

## Credits to [Hugging Face and the users who contributed](https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library)

This repository is simply a mirror of all[1] the concepts in [sd-concepts-library](https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library).

New concepts will be mirrored regularly.

The [sd-concepts-library](https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library) script `sd_concept_library_app.py` can take a while to download all the concepts. Cloning this repository will be faster.
