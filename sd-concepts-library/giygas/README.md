### giygas on Stable Diffusion
This is the `<giygas>` concept taught to Stable Diffusion via Textual Inversion. You can load this concept into the [Stable Conceptualizer](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_conceptualizer_inference.ipynb) notebook. You can also train your own concepts and load them into the concept libraries using [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_textual_inversion_training.ipynb).

Trained using the initializer token "swirl".
It will primarily generate patterns of usually red and black swirls, patterns that sometimes tile. It may be prone to triggering the "Potential NSFW content" check, despite the training data used.

Here is the new concept you will be able to use as an `object`:
